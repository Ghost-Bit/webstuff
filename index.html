    <br>This is my basic, barebones website hosted on github, if i ever feel like documenting something interesting, i'll probably put it in here :V<br>Did you know i own a Texas Instruments TI-92 Plus? It's a great calculator for suprising people with, and it's just the right amount of overkill that i can really appreciate in a little device like that.<br>If you wanna email me or something, do so at either Kingofnoodles27@gmail.com or Frankiemeanssausages641@gmail.com, there may be a chance i'll respond to you if you do so.<br><br>
  <br>UPDATE NOTE 1, 02/08/2021
  <br>Even though the site has had many updates done to it, this is the first i've decided to document directly on the website. I added a navigation bar under the website's name, with some of the website's pages in it.
  <br>UPDATE NOTE 2  04/20/2021
  <br>Coolstuff now has a chatroom i made in it, you should go check it out! :D
